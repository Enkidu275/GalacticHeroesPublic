Tablet A: Sargon (Alexander the Accursed, suicided for the freedom of Persia)
One day, a tablet was found, "Mankind will be unified in battle."
The Annunaki didn't really know what to make of the tablet, but the tablet was accidentally revealed to the humans by Nergal.
Innana began beating Nergal, or trying to. Nergal laughed, absorbing the punches, while patiently listening to a news broadcast.
Ninurta asked Innana to stop, and pointed out, "Nergal, is that throne made from the skulls of the coliseum contestants?"
Nergal laughed and responded, "That's very perceptive of you. Do you like it?"
Ninurta responded, "Disregarding any of our feelings on the matter, how will you maintain the decorum in the coliseum?"
Nergal widened his eyes and exclaimed, "You're right! I forgot!" Nergal walked to the back of the room, and grabbed a tablet.
He flicked his wrists on the tablet, "In Memoriam", set it by his throne, and sat down. The Annunaki didn't know how to respond.
The humans learned of the tablet, and one man believed he understood the message; Sargon Of Akkad.
Abandoned as a child, he had been a mercenary for the kingdom of Sumer, who were fending off the Kingdom of Lagash.
One day, Sargon ventured forth to the King Ur-Zababa, hopped up the fortress wall into the window, and requested an army.
"You want me to give you my army?" Ur-Zababa was smoking some weird form of tobacco from a beer-straw, barely-phased.
"Yes. I need your army to create a United Universe. That may seem evil, but it may be the only salvation for mankind."
"I know it's a difficult thing to accept, but we have to try, no matter the cost."
"If we win, you will be a hero. If we fail, you can claim it was my fault. I will accept such a burden."
Ur-Zababa pondered this for a minute, and noticed all of his unfinished paperwork on his desk.
"I accept your proposal. Starting today, you will be my regent, and you will lead my armies."
Ur-Zababa looked like he was going to stand up, then sat back down and requested "Could you fetch me a tablet?"
"Of course, my king." Sargon retrieved a tablet from the table and brought it to Ur-Zababa.
Ur-Zababa began to flick his wrists, non-chalantly offering an entire army to Sargon.
"There. Send this to my generals. Starting today, you're their commander. We'll begin with Lagash."
"Whether you like it or not, we have justification to raid them, which is what you intend to do, after all."
"Don't dissappoint me." Ur-Zababa seemed almost too infantile to be a real threat, but Sargon nodded politely.
That seemed suspiciously easier than Sargon had expected, but he didn't know why.

Sargon was now tasked with managing his generals in conquest of Lagash, an impregnable empire.
The reason for Lagash's ultimate defense was very simple; it was water-logged; built upon the islands of Shiburlaki.
One general pointed out, "We don't even know where the deep-sea trenches are, or Enlil's columns."
"They call Lagash the flood world of delirium for a reason."
Sargon looked annoyed, and turned away from his generals, addressing his soldiers directly.
Sargon turned and looked down toward his men, training in the armaments.
"Men, it has come to my attention that there has been a grave misunderstanding."
"We will not be enslaving planets like Hammurabi did. We will not be looting them."
"Our goal is not revenge. I am not even Sumerian. I am Akkadian. I fought for money."
"Vengeance is the virtue of the meek. Our goal is the incorporation of the Universe."
"I had a dream. A dream of a United Universe. One that could survive. It didn't need to be perfect."
"The tablet of the Annunaki predicted mankind united in battle. I wish for nothing more."
"We will not place nukes on Lagash, or a single world. We will win battles honestly, paid for in pain."
"I do not want cowards. I do not want opportunists. Nor will either find this to be a proper venue."
"We will fight war after war. We will pay with our lives. Because that's what it takes."
"Nuclear anhilation is a force worth any cost to prevent. Any cost, no matter how great."
"If you do not accept, I will not judge you. But leave. You will die for nothing."
He trained alongside his men, and carefully listened to the generals detail military strategy.
One day, while preparing, an envoy of Lagash arrived and requested Sargon.
"Our king has learned of your plans, and decided to join forces, should you accept."
"We do not like the Sumer. Our patrols used to stop their slave-vessels."
"Nonetheless, you seem to have managed to control their worst impulses."
And then an envoy from Elam and an envoy from Marhashi came.
All had heard of Sargon's plans, and wished to fight alongside him.
Soon, Sargon came to be known as Sargon the Great, mighty with a sword in battle.

The armies of Sargon were great and fierce, conquering planet after planet.
The sounds of muskets and cannons filled the air, the terror ended wars prematurely.
Brutal, effective. To Sargon, this prevented unnecessary bloodshed.
Sargon would offer one-on-one duels with the champions of other planets, to avoid it.
But few accepted. Perhaps Sargon was stronger than he thought.
Soon, they came upon the planet of Kazallu. Kazallu put up a fight, more than the others.
The losses to Sargon were not particularly significant, but his men grew weary.
Sargon was about to finalize an agreement with the fallen king, when his generals came in.
"You have done great work, but our men are tired, and we're going home."
"We'll pack up the spoils and leave. Nice work, Sargon the Great."
The fallen king was terrified; "But if you leave us with nothing, we'll be enslaved!"
They shot the fallen king with a musket. His brain matter flew across the tent wall.
"That's okay. We don't actually want him to sign that tablet anyway. Too much work."
Sargon, horrified, turned to his generals and requested, "Why? You fought for so long."
The generals laughed, "We originally didn't intend to. But the women were pretty cute."
"Also, we didn't need to force them. We have all of the money and spoils. Nature."
"Oh, don't look like that, dipshit. You did all of this so you could be a hero."
"So you could feel good. We tell you you're special, and you remove your panties."
"And you think your nimble little sword-tricks matter? You still look like a girl."
"The only reason no one fought you was because we would never honor your defeat."
"You were the only one on the entire battlefield that didn't understand that."
"It also didn't occur to you that the tablet was a reference to the coliseum."
"Listen to us, you are going to proclaim that the campaign was a failure. To go back."
"Mankind might forgive you. Maybe. It's your only hope. We don't care, ultimately."
"Thanks to that Akkadian bullshit of yours, they forgave us for our conquests."
The generals started to beat Sargon and tossed him into the dirt outside the tent.
It was raining and cold.
