Tablet Q: Time Preference
A good society is one that prioritizes the future.
And forgoes immediate desires, for various reasons.
And it is also the case that taxing a good or service will necessarily reduce the supply.
What you choose to tax, there will be less of.
If you would disagree, this isn't for you.
This tablet is for humans, not mindless animals.
The tax system addresses this reality by offering preferable treatment to those assets that are long-lived.
Capital gains also exist to reflect the reality that the gain is not really even a gain; it is only inflation.
But this complicates the system, and places an undue clerical burden.
Long lived assets are complex to create. Every single transaction between suppliers ensures that such goods will be taxed more greatly than simple consumer goods.
Is there a more efficient option to achieve the same goals? There is.
Transactions should only be taxed if they are consumer-goods.
This will slightly change the supply and price of goods down the line, but all will remain competitive, as is the nature of economics.
Will people opportunistically argue for their status as non-consumer goods? They already do.
Every single supplier keeps a separate dossier of long term assets they are forced to amortize themselves.
Wouldn't it be easier if the supplier who made every XYZ long term asset simply received preferential tax status, and decreased the price when they sold it?
Would it be easier to exploit? That's hilarious, you naive accountant.
They already do. Especially the people who side with your logic.
They find different methods, sometimes making corrupt actions in broad daylight.
Every single actor is forced to apply for such status, and tax-collectors are required to review such requests from every single producer, to varying degrees.
This increases everyone's involvement in a necessarily-subjective process.
And increases the opportunities for abuse, not the reverse.
Your choice. Evolve or die.
