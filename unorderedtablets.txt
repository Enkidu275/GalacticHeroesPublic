Tablet D: The False Illil-Bani
Following the defeat of Sumer, came the time of troubles; a period of significant turmoil.
Old allies blamed Sumer for the failure, and imposed unreasonable debts upon its people, soldier or not.
High-Prince Apsu was a sickly king, and a frail one. His wife Tiamat loved him regardless, and bore him many children.
The Third King of Lagash had stolen King Apsu's father, and demanded they repay the debt obligation or else.
Politics, particularly those positions reserved by the ambitious, nobility or not, attracted the ambitious.
And so it was, that the boyars of Apsu's throne sensed the weakness of King Apsu; his family and loved one's.
You see, they realized that Apsu was now weak. Esarhaddon, however, was much more audacious than the others.
Esarhaddon and his wife, Tomyris, decided to manufacture a story such that the sickly Apsu had cuckholded Esarhaddon.
They had a son, Illil-bani, who they intended to use as a puppet in order to rule Sumer. Illil-bani was also sickly.
Esarhaddon and Tomyris confronted Apsu after a tax-related dispute between some boyars that Apsu oversaw.
"Apsu, Tomyris revealed to me that Illil-bani is yours." Tomyris was crying in the corner very convincingly.
Tiamat stopped Esarhaddon, "Apsu would never do that, and also, he's sterile. He had sperm frozen, since he's the high-prince."
Tomyris immediately stopped crying and responded, "Reasonable. But also, you're a loose end, with his father."
"The boyars are getting particularly antsy, and so, who do you think they're going to believe?"
"Keep in mind that your authority is holding on by a thread, and that it wouldn't take much to push you."
Apsu yelled, "Get out now! You are not welcome here! If you ever return to my kingdom, I will have your heads!"
And so, the two left. Apsu enjoyed peace and quiet for a time. Until the next meeting of boyars.
The boyars began to inquire about Illil-bani, Apsu's bastard child. Apsu replied, "I have no such son."
This did not stop the boyars. The boyars began to demand Illil-bani as the rightful heir to the throne.
Tomyris was of noble blood, and specifically blood belonging to a nation they wanted as an ally.
Apsu thought Tomyris maybe looked like a Hitite. And the Hitite Empire wasn't particularly prosperous.
Illil-bani entered the room, with a crown on his head. He requested a private dialogue with King Apsu.
The two left the room, and Illil-bani revealed "I can't remove this crown. And it has a bomb, set to go off."
"Please! You have to declare me as the king! Or my parents and the boyars will kill me!"
The two stepped back into the room, with the boyars awaiting their arrival.
Apsu named the false Illil-bani as the High-Prince of all the peoples of Gir.
"But first, we must replace that crown, with a more-suitable one to rule."
Tomyris stepped out from a hidden location and said, "That's a great idea."
Illil-bani removed the crown from his head, and breathed a sigh of relief.
He wanted to refuse the crown, but now, all the boyars were watching the two of them.
Apsu placed his crown upon Illil-bani's head. Tomyris stepped forward and kissed Apsu.
"Don't let this get to your head" she whispered as she stepped back.
She knealt down to Illil-bani and whispered, "We are in control. Don't forget that."

Tablet ?: Born To Die
Apsu and Tiamat had been dethroned, but they still had their lives and happiness.
For them, that was enough. They began to enjoy more time with their children, playing in the snow.
When the Third King of Lagash heard of the news, he was unexpectedly decent about it.
Apsu's father was returned to him. His entire family had been returned to Apsu.
Apsu had been so busy in his duties, that he hadn't had the chance to enjoy such things.
But one day, Illil-bani returned once more. He looked visibly distressed.
"Tomyris and Esarhaddon want to go to war with Lagash! And they want me as their puppet!"
Apsu and his family were terrified. "Are you sure? You have to be sure!"
Illil-bani responded, "Yes! Tomyris is trying to create an alliance with the Hitites!"
Tiamat asked, "Did any of them follow you here? Maybe Esarhaddon?"
Illil-bani said, "No. Why Esarhaddon specifically?"
Tiamat explained, "Esarhaddon would never admit it, but he hates his wife, and you for existing."
"He would be the most inclined to kill you, in spite of Tomyris' plans."
"It's better that you not understand the reasons why. These are adult matters."
Suddenly, Esarhaddon ran out, with a dagger. He had been tailing Illil-bani.
Apsu's father stepped in the way of Illil-bani, and was stabbed by Esarhaddon.
He audibly screamed out in pain, and Esarhaddon seemingly became aware of his surroundings.
He looked at the family, paused and said, "Tomyris ordered me to send Illil-bani a message."
"So stop talking." Esarhaddon ran away, leaving them to mourn the loss of their family member.
Apsu was still of royal blood, and potentially a threat to Tomyris. They were not safe.

Tablet ?: 
The boyars held a funeral for Apsu's father. They seemed relatively respectful.
It seemed this had not been Tomyris' plan, or at least not yet. Apsu's family were quiet.
Apsu was physically-frail, surrounded by murderous noblemen dreaming of power.
His children were not yet of age to take the crown, and Esarhaddon might be regent.
The only thing preventing Esarhaddon, was that his wife would turn on him, and him on her.
But he didn't want to try to exploit that aspect of their nature. It would end badly.
The other noblemen did not share the same weaknesses that Tomyris and Esarhaddon had.
Apsu decided that he had only one single option; to consult the Third King of Lagash.
