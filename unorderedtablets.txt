Tablet D: The False Illil-Bani
Following the defeat of Sumer, came the time of troubles; a period of significant turmoil.
Old allies blamed Sumer for the failure, and imposed unreasonable debts upon its people, soldier or not.
High-Prince Apsu was a sickly king, and a frail one. His wife Tiamat loved him regardless, and bore him many children.
The Third King of Lagash had stolen King Apsu's father, and demanded they repay the debt obligation or else.
Politics, particularly those positions reserved by the ambitious, nobility or not, attract the ambitious.
And so it was, that the boyars of Apsu's throne sensed the weakness of King Apsu; his family and loved one's.
You see, they realized that Apsu was now weak. Esarhaddon, however, was much more audacious than the others.
Esarhaddon and his wife, Tomyris, decided to manufacture a story such that the sickly Apsu had cuckholded Esarhaddon.
They had a son, Illil-bani, who they intended to use as a puppet in order to rule Sumer. Illil-bani was also sickly.
Esarhaddon and Tomyris confronted Apsu after a tax-related dispute between some boyars that Apsu oversaw.
"Apsu, Tomyris revealed to me that Illil-bani is yours." Tomyris was crying in the corner very convincingly.
Tiamat stopped Esarhaddon, "Apsu would never do that, and also, he's sterile. He had sperm frozen, since he's the high-prince."
Tomyris immediately stopped crying and responded, "Reasonable. But also, you're a loose end, with his father."
"The boyars are getting particularly antsy, and so, who do you think they're going to believe?"
"Keep in mind that your authority is holding on by a thread, and that it wouldn't take much to push you."
Apsu yelled, "Get out now! You are not welcome here! If you ever return to my kingdom, I will have your heads!"
And so, the two left. Apsu enjoyed peace and quiet for a time. Until the next meeting of boyars.
The boyars began to inquire about Illil-bani, Apsu's bastard child. Apsu replied, "I have no such son."
This did not stop the boyars. The boyars began to demand Illil-bani as the rightful heir to the throne.
Tomyris was of noble blood, and specifically blood belonging to a nation they wanted as an ally.
Apsu didn't know Tomyris, or which nation she hailed from, and so he couldn't determine their intent.
Illil-bani entered the room, with a crown on his head. He requested a private dialogue with King Apsu.
The two left the room, and Illil-bani revealed "I can't remove this crown. And it has a bomb, set to go off."
"Please! You have to declare me as the king! Or my parents and the boyars will kill me!"
The two stepped back into the room, with the boyars awaiting their arrival.
Apsu named the false Illil-bani as the High-Prince of all the peoples of Gir.
"But first, we must replace that crown, with a more-suitable one to rule."
Tomyris stepped out from a hidden location and said, "That's a great idea."
Illil-bani removed the crown from his head, and breathed a sigh of relief.
He wanted to refuse the crown, but now, all the boyars were watching the two of them.
Apsu placed his crown upon Illil-bani's head. Tomyris stepped forward and kissed Apsu.
She knealt down to Illil-bani and whispered, "We are in control. Don't forget that."

Tablet ?: 
Apsu and Tiamat had been dethroned, but they still had their lives and happiness.
For them, that was enough. They began to enjoy more time with their children, playing in the snow.
When the Third King of Lagash heard of the news, he was unexpectedly decent about it.
Apsu's father was returned to him. His entire family had been returned to Apsu.
Apsu had been so busy in his duties, that he hadn't had the chance to enjoy such things.
But one day, Illil-bani returned once more. He looked visibly distressed.
"I was eating dinner, and they offered me a plate. It smelled funny, so I didn't eat it."
"But then, they began demanding that I eat it. I asked them to, and they threw it away."
