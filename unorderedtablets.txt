Tablet D: The False Illil-Bani
Following the defeat of Sumer, came the time of troubles; a period of significant turmoil.
Old allies blamed Sumer for the failure, and imposed unreasonable debts upon its people, soldier or not.
High-Prince Shulgi was a sickly king, and a frail one. His wife Simti loved him regardless, and bore him many children.
The Third King of Lagash had stolen King Apsu's father, and demanded they repay the debt obligation or else.
Politics, particularly those positions reserved by the ambitious, nobility or not, attracted the ambitious.
And so it was, that the boyars of Apsu's throne sensed the weakness of King Apsu; his family and loved one's.
You see, they realized that Shulgi was now weak. Apsu, however, was much more audacious than the others.
Apsu and his wife, Tiamat, decided to manufacture a story such that the sickly Shulgi had cuckholded Apsu.
They had a son, Illil-bani, who they intended to use as a puppet in order to rule Sumer. Illil-bani was also sickly.
Apsu and Tiamat confronted Shulgi after a tax-related dispute between some boyars that Shulgi oversaw.
"Apsu, Tiamat revealed to me that Illil-bani is yours." Tiamat was crying in the corner very convincingly.
Simti stopped Apsu, "Shulgi would never do that, and also, he's sterile. He had sperm frozen, since he's the high-prince."
Tiamat immediately stopped crying and responded, "Reasonable. But also, you're a loose end, with his father."
"The boyars are getting particularly antsy, and so, who do you think they're going to believe?"
"Keep in mind that your authority is holding on by a thread, and that it wouldn't take much to push you."
Shulgi yelled, "Get out now! You are not welcome here! If you ever return to my kingdom, I will have your heads!"
And so, the two left. Shulgi enjoyed peace and quiet for a time. Until the next meeting of boyars.
The boyars began to inquire about Illil-bani, Apsu's bastard child. Shulgi replied, "I have no such son."
This did not stop the boyars. The boyars began to demand Illil-bani as the rightful heir to the throne.
Tiamat was of noble blood, and specifically blood belonging to a nation they wanted as an ally.
Shulgi thought Tiamat maybe looked like a Hitite. And the Hitite Empire wasn't particularly prosperous.
Illil-bani entered the room, with a crown on his head. He requested a private dialogue with King Apsu.
The two left the room, and Illil-bani revealed "I can't remove this crown. And it has a bomb, set to go off."
"Please! You have to declare me as the king! Or my parents and the boyars will kill me!"
The two stepped back into the room, with the boyars awaiting their arrival.
Shulgi named the false Illil-bani as the High-Prince of all the peoples of Gir.
"But first, we must replace that crown, with a more-suitable one to rule."
Tiamat stepped out from a hidden location and said, "That's a great idea."
Illil-bani removed the crown from his head, and breathed a sigh of relief.
He wanted to refuse the crown, but now, all the boyars were watching the two of them.
Shulgi placed his crown upon Illil-bani's head. Tiamat stepped forward and kissed Apsu.
"Don't let this get to your head" she whispered as she stepped back.
She knealt down to Illil-bani and whispered, "We are in control. Don't forget that."

Tablet ?: Born To Die
Shulgi and Simti had been dethroned, but they still had their lives and happiness.
For them, that was enough. They began to enjoy more time with their children, playing in the snow.
When the Third King of Lagash heard of the news, he was unexpectedly decent about it.
Shulgi's father was returned to him. His entire family had been returned to Apsu.
Shulgi had been so busy in his duties, that he hadn't had the chance to enjoy such things.
But one day, Illil-bani returned once more. He looked visibly distressed.
"Tiamat and Apsu want to go to war with Lagash! And they want me as their puppet!"
Shulgi and his family were terrified. "Are you sure? You have to be sure!"
Illil-bani responded, "Yes! Tiamat is trying to create an alliance with the Hitites!"
Simti asked, "Did any of them follow you here? Maybe Apsu?"
Illil-bani said, "No. Why Apsu specifically?"
Simti explained, "Apsu would never admit it, but he hates his wife, and you."
Suddenly, Apsu ran out, with a dagger. He had been tailing Illil-bani.
Apsu's father stepped in the way of Illil-bani, and was stabbed by Apsu.
He audibly screamed out in pain, and Apsu seemingly became aware of his surroundings.
He looked at the family, paused and said, "Tiamat ordered me to send Illil-bani a message."
"So stop talking." Apsu ran away, leaving them to mourn the loss of their family member.
Shulgi was still of royal blood, and potentially a threat to Tiamat. They were not safe.

The boyars held a funeral for Shulgi's father. They seemed relatively respectful.
It seemed this had not been Tiamat' plan, or at least not yet. Apsu's family were quiet.
Shulgi was physically-frail, surrounded by murderous noblemen dreaming of power.
His children were not yet of age to take the crown, and Apsu might be regent.
Shulgi decided that he had only one single option; to consult the Third King of Lagash, Amar-Suen.
The family whispered among one another, fearful of anyone who may be listening in to the conversation.
One of Shulgi's children suggested that they establish a connection with Amar-Suen.
The boy explained that, using RSA-protocols, the messages could not be deciphered.
He went on to explain that, "But they will see the initial request for communication, and to whom it is addressed."
Shulgi suggested that "What if we attempt to plant an idea in Tiamat's head to have Illil-Bani lie to him?"
The boy said, "No. That would be too obvious. There's a better method. We will have Illil-Bani speak to the Hitites."
"The Hitites don't know the nature of our predicament. We can deceive their leaders into initiating the connection."
"We'll tell them that it needs to be secret, in order to avoid a paper-trail. Their leaders are very incompetent."
And so, the family had Illil-Bani speak to the Hitites, who then established a connection with Amar-Suen.
Amar-Suen was a fancy metro-sexual, sitting in an ornately-decorated bath. The Lagashi's loved bathing. And water.
"Well, hello there! It's nice to meet the new king of Sumer. I heard so much about you. How is your kingdom doing?"
Illil-Bani didn't understand and asked, "Didn't you impose a massive debt burden on Sumer?"
Amar-Suen replied, "Between you and me, I didn't really have a choice. We're already wealthy. We had to punish Shulgi's grandfather."
"You don't need to believe that. Believe that I, as your creditor, wish to see that your nation is prospering and can pay me back."
Illil-Bani was now angry, "We had a famine just five years ago! Millions died!"
Amar-Suen looked a little stunned, "We didn't bill you anything for these last ten years. Nothing came to us."
"We only kept Shulgi's father temporarily so that you wouldn't forget your obligations to us during those ten years."
Shulgi and Simti immediately widened their eyes. Shulgi took a deep breath, and then continued.
"The boyars are plotting an alliance with the Hitites to declare war on you."
"And they're trying to force Illil-Bani to be a part of it. That's why they dethroned me. And why they killed my father."
Amar-Suen was shocked, "Why did they kill your father? That doesn't even make any sense from a strategic perspective."
Simti responded, "It wasn't. Apsu did it accidentally, trying to kill Illil-Bani. Tiamat isn't the faithful type."
"Apsu and Tiamat's marital problems are the only reason any of us are even still alive."
"They even put some type of remote-detonating-crown on Illil-Bani's head, forcing him to do their bidding."
Amar-Suen looked terrified, but then a treacherous grin went across his face. He began to laugh.
"That gives me an idea. But you're going to need to prepare a bath, and maybe some cute attendants."

Tiamat entered the room of the boyars, and proclaimed, "The Hitites have somehow convinced Amar-Suen to visit us."
"We might not even need to engage in any war at all. You remember Illil-Bani's crown, right?"
The boyars nodded in agreement. Apsu interjected, "And now, Illil-Bani presents a threat to us."
Tiamat became very angry at Apsu, and proclaimed, "No. We'll put a crown on him, and Shulgi's family."
And so, a dinner banquet was to be held for Amar-Suen. He wanted to have a bath with Shulgi and Simti.
In the bath, Amar-Suen revealed "Sorry about this. I act degenerate in order to prevent people from listening."
"In order for the plan to work, we need to make sure that the boyars accept my offerings for you and the family."
