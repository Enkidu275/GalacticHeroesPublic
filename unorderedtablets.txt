Tablet A: Sargon (Alexander the Accursed, suicided for the freedom of Persia)
Nuclear anhilation was a force worth any cost to prevent. Any cost, no matter how great.
And it came that one day, a tablet was found, "Mankind will be unified in battle."
The Annunaki didn't really know what to make of the tablet, but the tablet was accidentally revealed to the humans by Nergal.
Innana began beating Nergal, or trying to. Nergal laughed, absorbing the punches, while patiently listening to a news broadcast.
The humans learned of the tablet, and one man believed he understood the message; dreaming of a united universe.
Sargon the Great was an Akkadian, but unlike his brothers, was quite the warrior. And like an Akkadian, he was a gifted orator.
Abandoned as a child, he had been a mercenary for the kingdom of Sumer, who were fending off the Kingdom of Lagash.
One day, Sargon the Great ventured forth to the King Ur-Zababa, hopped up the fortress wall into the window, and requested an army.
"You want me to give you my army?" Ur-Zababa was smoking some weird form of tobacco from a beer-straw, barely-phased.
"Yes. I need your army to create a United Universe. That may seem evil, but it may be the only salvation for mankind."
"I know it's a difficult thing to accept, but we have to try, no matter the cost."
"If we win, you will be a hero. If we fail, you can claim it was my fault. I will accept such a burden."
Ur-Zababa pondered this for a minute, and noticed all of his unfinished paperwork on his desk.
"I accept your proposal. Starting today, you will be my regent, and you will lead my armies."
Ur-Zababa looked like he was going to stand up, then sat back down and requested "Could you fetch me a tablet?"
"Of course, my king." Sargon retrieved a tablet from the table and brought it to Ur-Zababa.
Ur-Zababa began to flick his wrists, non-chalantly offering an entire army to Sargon.
"There. Send this to my generals. Starting today, you're their commander. We'll begin with Lagash."
"Whether you like it or not, we have justification to raid them, which is what you intend to do, after all."
"Don't dissappoint me." Ur-Zababa seemed almost too infantile to be a real threat, but Sargon nodded politely.
