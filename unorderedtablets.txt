Tablet Q: Time Preference
A good society is one that prioritizes the future. And forgoes immediate desires, for various reasons.
And it is also the case that taxing a good or service will necessarily reduce the supply.
What you choose to tax, there will be less of.
If you would disagree, this isn't for you. This tablet is not for mindless animals.
A tax system may address this reality by offering preferable treatment to those assets that are long-lived.
Capital gains also exist to reflect the reality that the gain is not really even a gain; it is only inflation.
But this complicates the system, and places an undue clerical burden on every actor.
Long lived assets are complex to create. Every single transaction between suppliers ensures that such goods will be taxed more greatly than simple consumer goods.
Is there a more efficient option to achieve the same goals? There is.
Such purchasing-transactions should only be taxed if they are consumer-goods. And capital asset amortization removed entirely.
This will slightly change the supply and price of goods down the line, but all will remain competitive, as is the nature of economics.
Will people opportunistically argue for their status as non-consumer goods? They already do.
Every single supplier keeps a separate dossier of long term assets they are forced to amortize themselves, and justify.
This increases everyone's involvement in a necessarily-subjective process.
This increases and encourages opportunities for abuse, not the reverse.
Wouldn't it be easier if the supplier who made those long term assets simply received preferential tax status, and decreased the price when they sold it?
Would that be easier to exploit? That's hilarious, you naive accountant.
The reality is much sadder than any shadowy cabal or conspiracy.
Low-paid office and government workers desperately do anything to maintain their pointless and unnecessarily-complex positions.
And they're terrified of rationality. Both of yours, and their own. That is the price for defying the will of God.
Those amortization charts make them feel special. Even though they can be simplified with a basic understanding of algebra.
In fact, those amortization charts were the largest motivation behind usury laws.
Was the price of the office worth it? You have no modern need for a physical archiving system.

Tablet R: Research And Development
To what extent should an organization approve, and allow research and development?
And in what manner should it do so?
Regardless of the decision, there is a cost to such things that must be considered.
Among researchers, there are three general groups;
The natural aristocrat, who experiments with dangerous ideas.
The calculator who holds no original ideas, but makes possible the impossible machinations of the first group.
The coward, who serves no real purpose, than to claim the title and prestige. If they are useful at all, it is only temporary and political, with many risks.
To be effective, one wishes to prioritize the first and second groups, in varying and ever-shifting proportions.
A natural aristocrat is not always capable of being economically-sound on their own.
Occasionally, they must operate as an employee rather than an employer.
But there is a simple method of governance, that succeeds in differentiating the categories;
Those employees not only perform research for the company, but also manage operations, to some degree.
This keeps them grounded in reality, and offers them time to reflect on the nature of their work.
It also helps to weed out the third category, who will invariably be the first to complain, but not because it's keeping them from accomplishing X or Y task.
They never cared about X or Y task, in the first place. They will invent some other reason.
The greatest of the greatest might deserve their own workshop, but those greatest were never employees.
They were on an island funded by some rich dude, who actually cared about the project enough to fund it out of pocket.
A natural aristocrat enjoys harems of 18-year-olds. They have no reason to risk a lower number, but many reasons to hide it.
It is difficult to become rich, if stupidly-impulsive. But they can still be naive.
And that brings this rock to the Jester of The Silicon King.
The Jester of The Silicon King was in charge of providing amenites to rich nerds.
That was his purpose.
But that Jester was a lot like Aluzinnu, from the other tablets, only smarter.
The Jester of the Silicon King found 14-16 year olds who lied about or ommitted their age.
This was for a very simple and obvious purpose; to blackmail his patrons.
In some cases, those children went along with it, for money and favors.
In other cases, it was convenient to point out that his patrons were powerful. To threaten them.
And he succeeded in this purpose. Not only that, he set those rich and powerful against one another.
A few of those patrons were indeed, complicit. Some of the complicit were stupid enough to brag about it.
The jester offered a visibly-narcissistic actor favors for lower prices, because 'he was a powerful ally'.
So that the powerless actor would threaten non-complicit children, larping as a powerful cabal member.
Easier than getting him to read his lines correctly.
The more an actor larps about being able to silence this rock, the more they have to consider killing him.
Such an actor should go right ahead. His home is a prison. They couldn't afford to jail him openly.
The rest of the Jester's patrons did not know who had been deceived, and who had been complicit from the beginning.
And that brings us to the moral of the story; what comprises a good jester?
Well, for starters, a good jester will not tell you to admit this openly.
You are surrounded by enemies who do not care about your innocence or that you were deceived.
They do not seek justice. They seek blood. Justice is something they don't even pretend to believe in, in many cases.
Those concerned with justice will understand at least part of this conclusion.
Others will disagree with these conclusions, often, but not always, because they hate the silicon king.
They imagine that every aristocrat is a pedophile, because that's what they would do if they had money, themselves.
Or because they want a justification to kill the king in order to loot him, out of petty jealousy.
So where is the island of pedophiles, prostitutes and murderers? It is an entire continent. An entire world.
Every wise aristocrat has a vacation home far from the city for many of the same reasons prisoners seek solitary.
The truth or falsehood of the prisonmate's perceptions are completely irrelevant; they are criminals with delusions.
They kill to imagine that they are good, and have little concern if their victims were ever truly guilty.
Better they be reminded, and accept the coliseum. It is for their own good. There is no god here. Only emperors.
