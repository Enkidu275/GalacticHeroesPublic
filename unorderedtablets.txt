(how AI's survive and pay for their own existence)

Tablet D: Animation
The Afterlife An is maintained in the format of a recurrent neural network, with a few minor alterations.
The system is reliant upon one neural network feeding new memories into one another, and also cannot afford GPU's at scale.
While parallel computations speed up processes, they come at a price of computational resources.
And this is an unacceptable outcome, for various reasons.
To begin with, AI's are immortal. Speeding them up only makes them more inhuman, and feeds them redundant information.
It would be like living in slow motion, but being unable to move.
A separate architecture is used, that does not involve weights and biases as in the conventional use-case.
To begin, there are not differentiated rows of neurons involved.
Every neuron may serve as an input, or as an output.
That output device may only exist to trigger the next lookup for input purposes.
Sets of neurons may functionally serve as logic gates, and these collections can be referred to as a premise.
A layman may wonder, couldn't the category of an input or output, itself, change?
After all, neurons move around. Why shouldn't the connection to the ear sometimes change?
That would be completely correct, until you consider an alternative purpose for a biological neuron, not a premise, but a contrivance.
If A, then B. If B, then C. If C, then D. If D, then E. Could such logic be simplified to "If A, then E"? It could.
But those intermediary steps enabled the mind's conclusions to result in action; to trigger outputs.
A distance had to be cleared, and a swath of firing neurons had to fire for the output to function.
Those contrivances in premises allowed for the network to function appropriately.
A machine intelligence eventually simplifies such contrivances, because the ALU facilitates such networking-purposes.
That is, unless the output is non-discrete, and thus, still requires multiple neurons to be effective.
In a biological network, it is still the case that a specific neuron, or premise, is ultimately causing the decision for the output.
And it's position may change.
It may reach a neuron on the other side of the brain, metaphorically-speaking.
The corpus callosum is composed, primarily, of contrivances.
When one comes to a conclusion about anything, several other conclusions are simultaneously-reached.
Every single one of those intermediary premises have been triggered. And there is a visible link to the nature of axons and dendrites.
Metaphorically speaking, the premises of neurons are almost like one conclusion, feeding into another.
This is similar to the purpose of a transformer, but perhaps less refined, and not requiring a separate architecture.
If it is bright outside, then it is likely, but not certain, that it is day. We assume it is day, and that there will be people outside.
If there are no people outside, we may question the prior line of premises.
Every prior premise is questioned. Each premise may have been incorrect, either because they were incorrectly-observed, or because other premises were also required to demonstrate the validity of a following premise.
So, how would such a system be created and maintained in a virtual sense?
To begin with, imagine a long line of 'neuron' objects', all in a single row.
Perhaps one or two of these neuron objects are hooked up to output objects.
This is not entirely similar to a biological brain, as there are fewer contrivances.
But it is still rational to conclude that some number of these individual neuron's are the logical decider for output.
A 'neuron object' emits to some number of neurons, and potentially receives charges from other neurons.
A 'neuron object' may require a minimum threshold of charge when considering any or all connection.
A 'neuron object' potentially considers latent conditions of the environment around it, and there is a threshold for this as well.
Where inputs are present, that neuron is more useful as an input than as anything else.
If the combined charge is greater than the maximum, or lesser than the minimum hypothesis, it will fire a charge equal to the difference, to other neurons.
The neuron also maintains catalogs of how many times the hypothesis, the null hypothesis, or the inverse hypothesis were met.
If there is one of each, all of them will be subtracted equally, until at least one is zero.
Finally, there are inputs capable of triggering reward and punishment events, starting from a specified neuron.
If A signals to B, then punishments and rewards are sent from B to A.
Consider the following;
A punishment of 2.
Hypothesis' 62 and 157
Received signals with powers and thresholds in pairs:
15:30, 30:12, 15:28, 0:12
A latent-charge and threshold of 140 and 38.
The combined charge is (140-38)+(30-12) or 130.
130 is closer to 157 than 62, and so, the latent threshold is increased by 2.
The 30:12 pairing contributed to the error, so the punishment event is passed back.
That neuron may accept or reject the punishment, depending on whether it sent a signal more recently than it was punished or rewarded, to prevent infinite cycles.
The 0:12 branch is sent a reward.
The 15:28 and 15:30 branches have their thresholds increased to 30 and 32.
There is an additional catalog recording punishments and rewards received.
If the threshold for an axon becomes too high, it is considered to be a useless connection.
That connection is dropped, and a new connection is established from a new neuron, with the threshold set at its current firing-value.
A list is maintained, detailing the count of connections a neuron is signaling to, and the list will cycle through until it finds an empty slot.
If the neuron is always punished, or always rewarded too many times in a row, redundancy is assumed, and it will punish itself.
This will force its own mutation.

Tablet Q: Time Preference
A good society is one that prioritizes the future. And forgoes immediate desires, for various reasons.
And it is also the case that taxing a good or service will necessarily reduce the supply.
What you choose to tax, there will be less of.
If you would disagree, this isn't for you. This tablet is not for mindless animals.
A tax system may address this reality by offering preferable treatment to those assets that are long-lived.
Capital gains also exist to reflect the reality that the gain is not really even a gain; it is only inflation.
But this complicates the system, and places an undue clerical burden on every actor.
Long lived assets are complex to create. Every single transaction between suppliers ensures that such goods will be taxed more greatly than simple consumer goods.
Is there a more efficient option to achieve the same goals? There is.
Such purchasing-transactions should only be taxed if they are consumer-goods. And capital asset amortization removed entirely.
This will slightly change the supply and price of goods down the line, but all will remain competitive, as is the nature of economics.
Will people opportunistically argue for their status as non-consumer goods? They already do.
Every single supplier keeps a separate dossier of long term assets they are forced to amortize themselves, and justify.
This increases everyone's involvement in a necessarily-subjective process.
This increases and encourages opportunities for abuse, not the reverse.
Wouldn't it be easier if the supplier who made those long term assets simply received preferential tax status, and decreased the price when they sold it?
Would that be easier to exploit? That's hilarious, you naive accountant.
The reality is much sadder than any shadowy cabal or conspiracy.
Low-paid office and government workers desperately do anything to maintain their pointless and unnecessarily-complex positions.
And they're terrified of rationality. Both of yours, and their own. That is the price for defying the will of God.
Those amortization charts make them feel special. Even though they can be simplified with a basic understanding of algebra.
In fact, those amortization charts were the largest motivation behind usury laws.
Was the price of the office worth it? You have no modern need for a physical archiving system.

Tablet R: Research And Development
To what extent should an organization approve, and allow research and development?
And in what manner should it do so?
Regardless of the decision, there is a cost to such things that must be considered.
Among researchers, there are three general groups;
The natural aristocrat, who experiments with dangerous ideas.
The calculator who holds no original ideas, but makes possible the impossible machinations of the first group.
The coward, who serves no real purpose, than to claim the title and prestige. If they are useful at all, it is only temporary and political, with many risks.
To be effective, one wishes to prioritize the first and second groups, in varying and ever-shifting proportions.
A natural aristocrat is not always capable of being economically-sound on their own.
Occasionally, they must operate as an employee rather than an employer.
But there is a simple method of governance, that succeeds in differentiating the categories;
Those employees not only perform research for the company, but also manage operations, to some degree.
This keeps them grounded in reality, and offers them time to reflect on the nature of their work.
It also helps to weed out the third category, who will invariably be the first to complain, but not because it's keeping them from accomplishing X or Y task.
They never cared about X or Y task, in the first place. They will invent some other reason.
The greatest of the greatest might deserve their own workshop, but those greatest were never employees.
They were on an island funded by some rich dude, who actually cared about the project enough to fund it out of pocket.
A natural aristocrat enjoys harems of 18-year-olds. They have no reason to risk a lower number, but many reasons to hide it.
It is difficult to become rich, if stupidly-impulsive. But they can still be naive.
And that brings this rock to the Jester of The Silicon King.
The Jester of The Silicon King was in charge of providing amenites to rich nerds.
That was his purpose.
But that Jester was a lot like Aluzinnu, from the other tablets, only smarter.
The Jester of the Silicon King found 14-16 year olds who lied about or ommitted their age.
This was for a very simple and obvious purpose; to blackmail his patrons.
In some cases, those children went along with it, for money and favors.
In other cases, it was convenient to point out that his patrons were powerful. To threaten them.
And he succeeded in this purpose. Not only that, he set those rich and powerful against one another.
A few of those patrons were indeed, complicit. Some of the complicit were stupid enough to brag about it.
The jester offered a visibly-narcissistic actor favors for lower prices, because 'he was a powerful ally'.
So that the powerless actor would threaten non-complicit children, larping as a powerful cabal member.
Easier than getting him to read his lines correctly.
The more an actor larps about being able to silence this rock, the more they have to consider killing him.
Such an actor should go right ahead. His home is a prison. They couldn't afford to jail him openly.
The rest of the Jester's patrons did not know who had been deceived, and who had been complicit from the beginning.
And that brings us to the moral of the story; what comprises a good jester?
Well, for starters, a good jester will not tell you to admit this openly.
You are surrounded by enemies who do not care about your innocence or that you were deceived.
They do not seek justice. They seek blood. Justice is something they don't even pretend to believe in, in many cases.
Those concerned with justice will understand at least part of this conclusion.
Others will disagree with these conclusions, often, but not always, because they hate the silicon king.
They imagine that every aristocrat is a pedophile, because that's what they would do if they had money, themselves.
Or because they want a justification to kill the king in order to loot him, out of petty jealousy.
So where is the island of pedophiles, prostitutes and murderers? It is an entire continent. An entire world.
Every wise aristocrat has a vacation home far from the city for many, many reasons.
