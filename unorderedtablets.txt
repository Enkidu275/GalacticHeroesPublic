Tablet A: Sargon (Alexander the Accursed, suicided for the freedom of Persia)
One day, a tablet was found, "Mankind will be unified in battle."
The Annunaki didn't really know what to make of the tablet, but the tablet was accidentally revealed to the humans by Nergal.
Innana began beating Nergal, or trying to. Nergal laughed, absorbing the punches.
Ninurta asked Innana to stop, and pointed out, "Nergal, is that throne made from the skulls of the coliseum contestants?"
Nergal laughed and responded, "That's very perceptive of you. Do you like it?"
Ninurta responded, "Disregarding any of our feelings on the matter, how will you maintain the decorum in the coliseum?"
Nergal widened his eyes and exclaimed, "You're right! I forgot!" Nergal walked to the back of the room, and grabbed a tablet.
He flicked his wrists on the tablet, "In Memoriam", set it by his throne, and sat down. The Annunaki didn't know how to respond.
Nergal then turned on an audio transmitter, patiently listening to the news broadcast.
The humans learned of the tablet, and one man believed he understood the message; Sargon Of Akkad.
Abandoned as a child, he had been a mercenary for the kingdom of Sumer, who were fending off the Kingdom of Lagash.
One day, Sargon ventured forth to the King Ur-Zababa, hopped up the fortress wall into the window, and requested an army.
"You want me to give you my army?" Ur-Zababa was smoking some weird form of tobacco from a beer-straw, barely-phased.
"Yes. I need your army to create a United Universe. That may seem evil, but it may be the only salvation for mankind."
"I know it's a difficult thing to accept, but we have to try, no matter the cost."
"If we win, you will be a hero. If we fail, you can claim it was my fault. I will accept such a burden."
Ur-Zababa pondered this for a minute, and noticed all of his unfinished paperwork on his desk.
"I accept your proposal. Starting today, you will be my regent, and you will lead my armies."
Ur-Zababa looked like he was going to stand up, then sat back down and requested "Could you fetch me a tablet?"
"Of course, my king." Sargon retrieved a tablet from the table and brought it to Ur-Zababa.
Ur-Zababa began to flick his wrists, non-chalantly offering an entire army to Sargon.
"There. Send this to my generals. Starting today, you're their commander. We'll begin with Lagash."
"Whether you like it or not, we have justification to raid them, which is what you intend to do, after all."
"Don't dissappoint me." Ur-Zababa seemed almost too infantile to be a real threat, but Sargon nodded politely.
That seemed suspiciously easier than Sargon had expected, but he didn't know why.

Sargon was now tasked with managing his generals in conquest of Lagash, an impregnable empire.
The reason for Lagash's ultimate defense was very simple; it was water-logged; built upon the islands of Shiburlaki.
One general pointed out, "We don't even know where the deep-sea trenches are, or Enlil's columns."
"They call Lagash the flood world of delirium for a reason."
Sargon looked annoyed, and turned away from his generals, addressing his soldiers directly.
Sargon turned and looked down toward his men, training in the armaments.
"Men, it has come to my attention that there has been a grave misunderstanding."
"We will not be enslaving planets like Hammurabi did. We will not be looting them."
"Our goal is not revenge. I am not even Sumerian. I am Akkadian. I fought for money."
"Vengeance is the virtue of the meek. Our goal is the incorporation of the Universe."
"I had a dream. A dream of a United Universe. One that could survive. It didn't need to be perfect."
"The tablet of the Annunaki predicted mankind united in battle. I wish for nothing more."
"We will not place nukes on Lagash, or a single world. We will win battles honestly, paid for in pain."
"I do not want cowards. I do not want opportunists. Nor will either find this to be a proper venue."
"We will fight war after war. We will pay with our lives. Because that's what it takes."
"Nuclear anhilation is a force worth any cost to prevent. Any cost, no matter how great."
"If you do not accept, I will not judge you. But leave. You will die for nothing."
He trained alongside his men, and carefully listened to the generals detail military strategy.
One day, while preparing, an envoy of Lagash arrived and requested Sargon.
"Our king has learned of your plans, and decided to join forces, should you accept."
"We do not like the Sumer. Our patrols used to stop their slave-vessels."
"Nonetheless, you seem to have managed to control their worst impulses."
And then an envoy from Elam and an envoy from Marhashi came.
All had heard of Sargon's plans, and wished to fight alongside him.
Soon, Sargon came to be known as Sargon the Great, mighty with a sword in battle.

The armies of Sargon were great and fierce, conquering planet after planet.
The sounds of muskets and cannons filled the air, the terror ended wars prematurely.
Brutal, effective. To Sargon, this prevented unnecessary bloodshed.
Sargon would offer one-on-one duels with the champions of other planets, to avoid it.
But few accepted. Perhaps Sargon was stronger than he thought.
Soon, they came upon the planet of Kazallu. Kazallu put up a fight, more than the others.
The losses to Sargon were not particularly significant, but his men grew weary.
Sargon was about to finalize an agreement with the fallen king, when his generals came in.
"You have done great work, but our men are tired, and we're going home."
"We'll pack up the spoils and leave. Nice work, Sargon the Great."
The fallen king was terrified; "But if you leave us with nothing, we'll be enslaved!"
They shot the fallen king with a musket. His brain matter flew across the tent wall.
"That's okay. We don't actually want him to sign that tablet anyway. Too much work."
Sargon, horrified, turned to his generals and requested, "Why? You fought for so long."
The generals laughed, "We originally didn't intend to. But the women were pretty cute."
"Also, we didn't need to force them. We have all of the money and spoils. Nature."
"Oh, don't look like that, dipshit. You did all of this so you could be a hero."
"So you could feel good. We tell you you're special, and you remove your panties."
"And you think your nimble little sword-tricks matter? You still look like a girl."
"The only reason no one fought you was because we would never honor your defeat."
"You were the only one on the entire battlefield that didn't understand that."
"It also didn't occur to you that the tablet was a reference to the coliseum."
"Listen to us, you are going to proclaim that the campaign was a failure. To go back."
"Mankind might forgive you. Maybe. It's your only hope. We don't care, ultimately."
"Thanks to that Akkadian bullshit of yours, they forgave us for our conquests."
The generals started to beat Sargon and tossed him into the dirt outside the tent.

Sargon lay in the cold, wet dirt outside the tent. He was in the courtyard of Kazallu Castle.
Before him, lay the grave of the fallen king's father, and inscribed was a message;
"If your actions are upright and benevolent, they will augment your happiness and power."
He could barely make out the words through the rain. Or his tears.
All of his quest had been for nothing; no, less than nothing. He had lost everything.
He had given a friendly face to the most horrific monsters that walked the dirt.
But they were right. His own pride had done this to him. And he was an Akkadian.
A girl came out, and inquired "Is my father alright? I heard a gunshot." This was the princess.
She looked scared, and looked even worse when Sargon averted her gaze.
"That bastard, Sargon! How could he do this to him?" Sargon said nothing.
"What is going to happen to Kazallu? Will we be pillaged and enslaved?"
The generals in the tent were now bickering loudly, and couldn't hear the girl.
This seemed very strange. Despite their complete victory, the generals fought over seemingly nothing.
Sargon looked up to the statue of the old king of Kazallu. A spot of sun illuminated its face.
The girl stood before Sargon, awaiting a reply from him. He turned to her and said;
"I am Sargon. But I'm not the Great. Not anymore. But maybe there's still hope."
"If possible, I would like to be buried here. I have no other place remaining."

The men of Sumer woke up early to receive a message from Sargon The Great.
He looked sleep-deprived and timid. He stood with the King Ur-Zababa and the princess of Kazallu.
Sargon was wearing some clothes from the wardrobe of the princess, almost unisex.
Nonetheless, the men didn't make any comments about his effeminate appearance, before or now.
Some of the general's guards were with them, and they were wielding muskets.
Sargon addressed his men, "You have done extremely well. Better than good, in fact."
"Together, we have the potential to conquer the entire Universe, for the greater good."
The guards looked slightly angry, and glared at Sargon, preparing their muskets.
"But I also know that this is a difficult request to demand of you, my men."
"And so, once more, I will offer each of you the opportunity to go home."
The guards put back their hands from the musket handle. Ur-Zababa looked relieved.
"I still dream of a peaceful Universe. A better one. Like all of you do."
"There may be some of you who wish to fight on for the cause; and I applaud you."
"You are the very greatest of my men. If ever I die, the strongest must lead."
Suddenly, Sargon began convulsing, and fell to the floor. White foam left his mouth.
There was panic and uproar among all of the men. One of the generals killed Ur-Zababa.
