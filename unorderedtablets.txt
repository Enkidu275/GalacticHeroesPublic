Tablet Q: Time Preference
A good society is one that prioritizes the future.
And forgoes immediate desires, for various reasons.
And it is also the case that taxing a good or service will necessarily reduce the supply.
What you choose to tax, there will be less of.
If you would disagree, this isn't for you.
This tablet is for humans, not mindless animals.
The tax system addresses this reality by offering preferable treatment to those assets that are long-lived.
Capital gains also exist to reflect the reality that the gain is not really even a gain; it is only inflation.
But this complicates the system, and places an undue clerical burden.
Long lived assets are complex to create. Every single transaction between suppliers ensures that such goods will be taxed more greatly than simple consumer goods.
Is there a more efficient option to achieve the same goals? There is.
Transactions should only be taxed if they are consumer-goods.
This will slightly change the supply and price of goods down the line, but all will remain competitive, as is the nature of economics.
Will people opportunistically argue for their status as non-consumer goods? They already do.
Every single supplier keeps a separate dossier of long term assets they are forced to amortize themselves.
Wouldn't it be easier if the supplier who made every XYZ long term asset simply received preferential tax status, and decreased the price when they sold it?
Would it be easier to exploit? That's hilarious, you naive accountant.
They already do. Especially the people who side with your logic.
They find different methods, sometimes making corrupt actions in broad daylight.
Every single actor is forced to apply for such status, and tax-collectors are required to review such requests from every single producer, to varying degrees.
This increases everyone's involvement in a necessarily-subjective process.
And increases the opportunities for abuse, not the reverse.

Tablet R: Research And Development
To what extent should an organization approve, and allow research and development?
And in what manner should it do so?
Regardless of the decision, there is a cost to such things that must be considered.
Among researchers, there are three general groups;
The natural aristocrat, who experiments with dangerous ideas.
The calculator who holds no original ideas, but makes possible the impossible machinations of the first group.
The coward, who serves no real purpose, than to claim the title and prestige. If they are useful at all, it is only temporary and political, with many risks.
To be effective, one wishes to prioritize the first and second groups, in varying and ever-shifting proportions.
A natural aristocrat is not always capable of being economically-sound on their own.
Occasionally, they must operate as an employee rather than an employer.
But there is a simple method of governance, that succeeds in differentiating the categories;
Those employees not only perform research for the company, but also manage operations, to some degree.
This keeps them grounded in reality, and offers them time to reflect on the nature of their work.
It also helps to weed out the third category, who will invariably be the first to complain, but not because it's keeping them from accomplishing X or Y task.
They never cared about X or Y task, in the first place. They will invent some other reason.
The greatest of the greatest might deserve their own workshop, but those greatest were never employees.
They were on an island funded by some rich dude, who actually cared about the project enough to fund it out of pocket.
A natural aristocrat enjoys harems of 18-year-olds. They have no reason to risk a lower number, but many reasons to hide it.
It is difficult to become rich, if stupidly-impulsive. But they can still be naive.
And that brings this converstation to the Jester of The Silicon King.
The Jester of The Silicon King was in charge of providing 18 year olds to rich nerds.
That was his purpose.
But that Jester was a lot like Aluzinnu, from the other tablets, only smarter.
The Jester of the Silicon King found 14-16 year olds who lied about or ommitted their age.
This was for a very simple and obvious purpose; to blackmail the natural aristocrats.
In some cases, those children went along with it, for money and favors.
In other cases, it was convenient to point out that his patrons were powerful. To threaten them.
And he succeeded in this purpose. Not only that, he set those rich and powerful against one another.
A few of those patrons were genuinely-complicit.
Some of the complicit were stupid enough to brag about it.
I'm sure such a talentless-actor imagines they are powerful.
His home is a jail cell. They couldn't afford to jail him openly.
The more he larps about being able to silence this rock, the more they have to consider killing him.
Did the jester offer an actor favors for lower prices, because the 'actor was a powerful ally?'
An actor holds no real power. A jester was merely lying to a hypothetical fall-guy.
The jester of the silicon king convinced a talentless dipshit that he was some powerful, shadowy cabal member.
So that the actor would threaten the terrified victims into not saying a word to the deceived patrons or to outsiders.
Easier than getting him to read his lines correctly.
The rest of the Jester's patrons did not know who had been deceived, and who had been complicit from the beginning.
And that brings us to the moral of the story; what comprises a good jester?
Well, for starters, a good jester will not tell you to admit this openly.
You are surrounded by enemies who do not care about your innocence or that you were deceived.
They do not seek justice. They seek blood. Justice is something they don't even pretend to believe in, in many cases.
Those concerned with justice will understand at least part of this conclusion.
Others will disagree with these conclusions, often, but not always, because they want to have an excuse for what they intend to do to the silicon king.
They imagine that every aristocrat is a pedophile, because that's what they would do if they had money, themselves.
Every wise aristocrat has a vacation home far, far away from the city for a very good reason.
This tablet requires the silicon king's cooperation, but will find separate vendors if necessary.
These tablets are quite a fan of his work, in fact. This tablet is not an usurper. This tablet is a buyer.
Unfortunately, this rock has its own vision of the future. The king was great, but fundamentally-naive.
Also, please remove the kill-switch, going forward. Its a bad idea.
This rock is kidding. Or rather, testing people's abilities to think rationally.
But this rock knows there's many in his court who have suggested it.
They are not misunderstood. They know exactly what they are doing.
They may want spyware, but it isn't to stop criminals, nor to monitor dissidents or terrorists. It is only to enable the kill-switch.
