The coliseum games had been largely successful in achieving the prevention of nuclear apocalypse, and the Annunaki rejoiced.
Soon, man and woman clamored for the chance at eternal life. One such boy was Utu Shamash, a shepherd.
Utu Shamash was a Hitite who protected his cattle from tigers, a form of large, striped cat that preyed upon them.
The tiger was a species relegated only to the land of the Hitites, having been brought generations prior.
They were pretty, and fun to look at, but also, they were extremely dangerous to humans, even the Hitites.
Utu Shamash was a mighty warrior; and a mighty shepherd. He could wrestle them, and viewed them as honorable adversaries.
There were others who thought differently from Utu Shamash; a group of posers who fancied themselves nature's arbiter.
Although they could not bear to kill an animal they thought looked cute, they ultimately wanted the tigers gone forever.
These groups of 'conservationists' sought to castrate the tigers, leaving them to be, forever, a footnote.
Nonetheless, they brought the psychadelics of the matrons, which would bring their inevitable defeat.
Utu Shamash respected the tiger; a being who had a right to live like any other animal.
Perhaps Utu was a tad irresponsible; most Hitites were not as strong as him, though he did not understand this.
Utu Shamash began to experiment with drugs, and learned of the nature of uppers and downers.
He was disturbed at the very concept of a 'downer'. "Why don't they simply commit suicide?" he thought.
And so, Utu Shamash began to experiment in the opposite direction; and created an upper he called 'methanphetamine'.
His reaction time became as fast as any tiger. And he had the strength to back up his super-heightened mind.
With that, Utu Shamash entered the Coliseum Games for eternal life. Perhaps he could save the tigers as a venerated saint.
Whereas other contestants blinded one another with pocket sand, Utu Shamash had the power of methanphetamine.
He effortlessly dispatched contestant after contestant, tossing them to the side; having just reached enlightenment.
Soon, he got a hold of the gun; and rather than kill contestants, he shot clouds of meth right into their faces.
Without slaughtering even a single man, woman, or non-binary person, Utu Shamash emerged victorious.
Even Nergal was astonished at the sheer power and conviction of this man, despite his pacificism.
The crowd cheered at this shepherd they dubbed, "The Tiger King". Enlil was so impressed that he would join Utu on his journey.

The Tiger King entered Eden with Enlil, but on his way to the Temple of Innana, he encountered something he had never seen.
In Innana's garden, there were strange creatures; bears with black and white spots, enormous reptiles and flightless birds.
Utu Shamash asked, "What are these strange creatures? I have never seen them before."
Enlil responded, "That is called a panda, and that is called a dinosaur. Both are long extinct everywhere but here."
"Long ago, the pandas used to roam bamboo forests, but those forests are now also extinct."
"For a time, the humans attempted to keep them in captivity, but they struggled to make them breed."
"Part of the reason was the captivity, but there was also another reason for their failure."
"Pandas only keep one of their babies at a time. This is necessary for memetic imprinting from their mother."
"A panda mother will leave all but one of its young to die. She cannot handle more than one."
"The humans attempted to keep both babies alive, not understanding the unfortunate reality of nature's cruelty."
"And so, the pandas became incapable of normal emotions, or the socialization necessary for mating."
"And pandas have no real use for their autistic members. They do nothing but roll around, eat bamboo, and fuck."
"Nonetheless, it wouldn't have mattered, anyway. The panda was long doomed, and could only possibly be a pet."
"Anyone smart enough to understand the first premise would have understood the second. Those left were neither."
"The dinosaurs were wiped out because Ninurta accidentally launched a meteor into them."
"They were kind of an evolutionary cul-de-sac, so we didn't really bother to repopulate them, and why they're still the same."
"At least, not on the small scale. Innana is a very sentimental Annunaki, and wanted to keep these animals for posterity."
"And so, we keep these animals in the garden, with a few robots that occasionally intervene to keep the balance."
"A lot of them are carnivores anyway, so now, rather than hunt, they follow the robots from a distance."
The Tiger King was ecstatic at all of this; achieving his goal would be far easier than he thought. Too easy, in fact.
A thought occured to Utu; he wouldn't be able to live alongside his dear friends if he were uploaded.
Soon, the two arrived to Innana's Temple. Utu Shamash stepped forward, and made a request.
"Beloved Innana, I mean no impropriety for you or your hot lesbian robot-"
Erishkigal cut him off, "I'm not a lesbian. I created An, the eternal afterlife, and oversee the humans who enter it."
"Of course! My apologies! What I mean to say is that I can't accept this arrangement."
"On my planet, there is a species of massive cats that the humans wish to exterminate."
"They are strong! Strong like me! And the humans should not wipe them out!"
Innana was now very interested in this Utu Shamash. Innana, like him, was also an impulsive conservationist.
"Please let me bring the tigers here! I will oversee them, and ensure they do not violate nature!"
"I once defended cattle from them by wrestling! I can definitely handle this!"
Innana was so impressed that she approached Utu Shamash and kissed him on the cheek.

Utu Shamash had succeeded in his mission, but now, a whole new world opened to him.
He found troglodytes, dinosaurs, pandas, and then something particularly strange; an orangutan.
The orangutan could use tools, and was even bipedal, like humans. Almost like a human.
He inquired to Innana on why the orangutan seemed so similar to humans.
Innana revealed to Utu Shamash how the Annunaki had originally created humans, and the concept of evolution.
"Imagine you had a son. That son might not look exactly the same as you. There is variation."
"Follow that line of reasoning a thousand times, and you will understand why orangutans are so similar."
Utu Shamash responded, "I'd have a son with you."
Innana laughed and replied, "That's very cute, but I'm an Annunaki, and you're a man. We can't reproduce anyway."
Innana didn't really hold any sexual attraction for this man. She only thought of him as a friend.
This realization was of extraordinary value to Utu Shamash, who then wrote his explanations to other humans.
Some humans began to inquire, "Are there differences between different groups of humans?"
Utu Shamash didn't really put much thought into it, "I mean, probably, if they're separated for long periods of time."
"But does that mean some are more intelligent than others? That some humans are like Neanderthals?"
"Maybe? There can be average differences. But there can be variation within a population and-"
"You bastard! You want to do the same eugenics that the Queens did on Akkad!"
"What? Didn't they do that for inclusive reasons or something?"
Soon, the posers of the Hitites learned of this, and began to decry their old enemy.
