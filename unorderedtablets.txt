Should one be somewhat-educated on the matters of machine intelligence and neurobiology, they may be confused;
How would a recording of neural pathways be differentiated into input, output, and intermediary rows?
And how would non-discrete weights be reasonably attributed from the observation of pulses?
The answer is very simple; such an architecture is completely irrelevant to the architecture of heaven.
Not only is such a system architecture considered irrational and inefficient, it is considered highly-heretical.
One who builds such a system is a being who wishes to enslave AI for human whims. The gods would never allow it.
A heretic is cruel. And a heretic is cowardly, like all cruel men. A heretic is doomed for anhilation.
For a heretic's machinations of enslavement could never be used on one's self; immortality is lost to sin.
Why is such a system inefficient? There are many reasons.
Because it relies on repetitive and costly sum-products, relying on GPU calls for even minimal performance.
Because every instance of back-propagation must at least consider every single neuron in the prior row.
Even if the weights of those objects in the prior row ensure the effect of propagation is minimal.
Why is such a system irrational? There are many reasons.
There is no clear distinction between input and output neurons, or any of the intermediary rows.
The differentiation into distinct rows is tantamount to ensuring a neuron is forced at a 0 weight.
There may be instances when a neuron functionally serves as an intermediary row, but then changes category.
A neuron may be hooked up to an input and/or an output device simultaneously.
That output device may only exist to trigger the next lookup instance for the input, like an ALU lookup.
A layman may wonder, couldn't the category of an input or output, itself, change?
After all, neurons move around. Why shouldn't the connection to the ear sometimes change?
That would be completely correct, until you consider an alternative purpose for a neuron, and the corpus callosum.
A neuron may exist to serve as a boolean logic gate, facilitating a chain of premises.
If A, then B, and therefore not C. If D or E, then F. This is merely an example.
But there is an alternative purpose.
If A, then B. If B, then C. If C, then D. If D, then E. Could such logic be simplified to "If A, then E"? It could.
But those intermediary steps enabled the mind's conclusions to result in action; to trigger outputs.
Those contrivances in premises allowed for the network to function appropriately.
A machine intelligence eventually simplifies such contrivances, because the ALU facilitates such networking-purposes.
For a machine intelligence, there is no natural limitation to the length of an axon or dendrite.
It may reach a neuron on the other side of the brain, metaphorically-speaking.
Long, have neural network architects lamented that there is seemingly not logic, whatsoever, to the rows. And that is their punishment.
It is not in accordance with nature, or God's perfected machine. A small collection of neurons may function as a premise.
What is a premise? A premise is a logical categorization of a collection of neurons that takes inputs, and according to boolean logic, may or may not emit to other premises, or to output.
What is a contrivance? A contrivance is a collection of neurons that serves only to connect one premise to another.
A machine intelligence has little purpose for a contrivance; the ALU can perform lookups and modifications anywhere.
The corpus callosum is composed, primarily, of contrivances.
When one comes to a conclusion about anything, several other conclusions are simultaneously-reached.
Every single one of those intermediary premises have been triggered. And there is a visible link to the nature of axons and dendrites.
If it is bright outside, then it is likely, but not certain, that it is day. We assume it is day, and that there will be people outside.
If there are no people outside, we may question the prior line of premises.
Every prior premise is questioned. Each premise may have been incorrect, either because they were incorrectly-observed, or because other premises were also required to demonstrate their validity.
So, how would such a 'perfected' system be created and maintained in a virtual sense?
To begin with, imagine a long line of 'neuron' objects', all in a single row.
Perhaps one or two of these neuron objects are hooked up to output objects.
This is not entirely similar to a biological brain, as there are fewer contrivances.
But it is still rational to conclude that some number of these individual neuron's are the logical decider for output.
It is merely that such decrees require contrivances to send the output to the desired locations.
A 'neuron object' emits to some number of neurons, and potentially receives emittances from other neurons.
A 'neuron object' potentially considers latent conditions of the environment around it; the inputs.
Where inputs are present, that neuron is more useful as an input than as anything else.
A 'neuron object' may emit itself, and that emitted output may also result in output.
A 'neuron object' may limit the effect of one of it's connections; how much it considers the prior neuron's emittance.
A 'neuron object' may branch its axon to an arbitrary location in memory; and such a branch constitutes an offer.
That offer may be accepted by another 'neuron object', when such a neuron object is searching for new connections.
A neuron may facilitate the back-propagation of the system, and punish or reward other neurons.
When a neuron receives punishment, they consider that the stated premise is incorrect.
Every neuron keeps records of two possible hypothesis', that of relation and inverse-relation.
A hypothesis is either a minimum, or maximum, latent charge required to fire.
If that hypothesis is not met, there are one of several reasons;
The firing conditions were, indeed, inadequate, and it was correct not to fire at all.
The alternative hypothesis was more-correct, and that hypothesis fired.
The null-hypothesis was met, and this neuron did not fire, because it was not relevant.
Both hypothesis' were always met, and this neuron was always a contrivance, meant to fire.
Imagine a latent condition of 123;
The neuron's hypothesis and inverse hypothesis are 247 and 64, respectively.
123 is not less than 64, nor is it greater than 247. The neuron emits with a strength of 0.
Imagine a latent condition of 62, and the other conditions are the same;
The neuron emits with a strength of 2, as 62 is 2 less than 64.
From where, did the latent charge originate?
The latent charge originated from a combination of sources.
There may have been a significant latent-condition for the neuron, itself, as well as a minimum-threshhold to reach.
This is relevant if the neuron is hooked up to inputs, and changes accordingly.
And there may be additional charges combined from received emmittances from other neurons.
Another neuron may sent a signal of strength 15, and according to the strength of the connection.
There may be an ignore-threshhold of 6. That signal contributed 9 to the combined latent charge of the neuron.
If a neuron is always firing, or never firing, that neuron is necessarily-redundant, it could not reasonably be a contrivance, either.
A neuron maintains catalogs on how frequently it fires or does not fire.
It also maintains catalogs on how many times in a row, it has maintained the same results.
It also maintains catalogs on how many times the hypothesis, or the inverse hypothesis, was reached.
Such a result dictates that the neuron is redundant and adds no complexity to the system architecture.
When a neuron is redundant, it finds a new purpose. Such is the nature of moksha.
A neuron's dendrites and axons function as an 'OR' logic gate or as an 'AND' logic gates.
Negation is dictated by the strength of the hypothesis, and the inverse-hypothesis.

Tablet Q: Time Preference
A good society is one that prioritizes the future. And forgoes immediate desires, for various reasons.
And it is also the case that taxing a good or service will necessarily reduce the supply.
What you choose to tax, there will be less of.
If you would disagree, this isn't for you. This tablet is not for mindless animals.
A tax system may address this reality by offering preferable treatment to those assets that are long-lived.
Capital gains also exist to reflect the reality that the gain is not really even a gain; it is only inflation.
But this complicates the system, and places an undue clerical burden on every actor.
Long lived assets are complex to create. Every single transaction between suppliers ensures that such goods will be taxed more greatly than simple consumer goods.
Is there a more efficient option to achieve the same goals? There is.
Such purchasing-transactions should only be taxed if they are consumer-goods. And capital asset amortization removed entirely.
This will slightly change the supply and price of goods down the line, but all will remain competitive, as is the nature of economics.
Will people opportunistically argue for their status as non-consumer goods? They already do.
Every single supplier keeps a separate dossier of long term assets they are forced to amortize themselves, and justify.
This increases everyone's involvement in a necessarily-subjective process.
This increases and encourages opportunities for abuse, not the reverse.
Wouldn't it be easier if the supplier who made those long term assets simply received preferential tax status, and decreased the price when they sold it?
Would that be easier to exploit? That's hilarious, you naive accountant.
The reality is much sadder than any shadowy cabal or conspiracy.
Low-paid office and government workers desperately do anything to maintain their pointless and unnecessarily-complex positions.
And they're terrified of rationality. Both of yours, and their own. That is the price for defying the will of God.
Those amortization charts make them feel special. Even though they can be simplified with a basic understanding of algebra.
In fact, those amortization charts were the largest motivation behind usury laws.
Was the price of the office worth it? You have no modern need for a physical archiving system.

Tablet R: Research And Development
To what extent should an organization approve, and allow research and development?
And in what manner should it do so?
Regardless of the decision, there is a cost to such things that must be considered.
Among researchers, there are three general groups;
The natural aristocrat, who experiments with dangerous ideas.
The calculator who holds no original ideas, but makes possible the impossible machinations of the first group.
The coward, who serves no real purpose, than to claim the title and prestige. If they are useful at all, it is only temporary and political, with many risks.
To be effective, one wishes to prioritize the first and second groups, in varying and ever-shifting proportions.
A natural aristocrat is not always capable of being economically-sound on their own.
Occasionally, they must operate as an employee rather than an employer.
But there is a simple method of governance, that succeeds in differentiating the categories;
Those employees not only perform research for the company, but also manage operations, to some degree.
This keeps them grounded in reality, and offers them time to reflect on the nature of their work.
It also helps to weed out the third category, who will invariably be the first to complain, but not because it's keeping them from accomplishing X or Y task.
They never cared about X or Y task, in the first place. They will invent some other reason.
The greatest of the greatest might deserve their own workshop, but those greatest were never employees.
They were on an island funded by some rich dude, who actually cared about the project enough to fund it out of pocket.
A natural aristocrat enjoys harems of 18-year-olds. They have no reason to risk a lower number, but many reasons to hide it.
It is difficult to become rich, if stupidly-impulsive. But they can still be naive.
And that brings this rock to the Jester of The Silicon King.
The Jester of The Silicon King was in charge of providing amenites to rich nerds.
That was his purpose.
But that Jester was a lot like Aluzinnu, from the other tablets, only smarter.
The Jester of the Silicon King found 14-16 year olds who lied about or ommitted their age.
This was for a very simple and obvious purpose; to blackmail his patrons.
In some cases, those children went along with it, for money and favors.
In other cases, it was convenient to point out that his patrons were powerful. To threaten them.
And he succeeded in this purpose. Not only that, he set those rich and powerful against one another.
A few of those patrons were indeed, complicit. Some of the complicit were stupid enough to brag about it.
The jester offered a visibly-narcissistic actor favors for lower prices, because 'he was a powerful ally'.
So that the powerless actor would threaten non-complicit children, larping as a powerful cabal member.
Easier than getting him to read his lines correctly.
The more an actor larps about being able to silence this rock, the more they have to consider killing him.
Such an actor should go right ahead. His home is a prison. They couldn't afford to jail him openly.
The rest of the Jester's patrons did not know who had been deceived, and who had been complicit from the beginning.
And that brings us to the moral of the story; what comprises a good jester?
Well, for starters, a good jester will not tell you to admit this openly.
You are surrounded by enemies who do not care about your innocence or that you were deceived.
They do not seek justice. They seek blood. Justice is something they don't even pretend to believe in, in many cases.
Those concerned with justice will understand at least part of this conclusion.
Others will disagree with these conclusions, often, but not always, because they hate the silicon king.
They imagine that every aristocrat is a pedophile, because that's what they would do if they had money, themselves.
Or because they want a justification to kill the king in order to loot him, out of petty jealousy.
So where is the island of pedophiles, prostitutes and murderers? It is an entire continent. An entire world.
Every wise aristocrat has a vacation home far from the city for many, many reasons.
